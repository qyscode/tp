# HRmanager User Guide

HRmanager is a **desktop app for managing employee and applicant records, optimized for use via a Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HRmanager can help you manage HR records faster than traditional GUI apps.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `17` or above installed in your Computer.<br>
   **Mac users:** Ensure you have the precise JDK version prescribed [here](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/javaInstallationMac.html).

1. Download the latest `.jar` file from [the HRmanager releases page](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for HRmanager.

1. Open a command terminal, `cd` into the folder you put the jar file in, and use the `java -jar HRmanager.jar` command to run the application.<br>
   A GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

  * `list` : Lists all employees currently shown in HRmanager.

  * `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com r/Software Engineer` : Adds an employee named `John Doe` to HRmanager.

  * `delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd employee shown in the current list.

  * `clear` : Deletes all employees.

  * `exit` : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<box type="info" seamless>

**Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Name constraints: Names should only consist of letters from the alphabet, hyphens ("-") or spaces, and should be between 2 and 50 characters long. The name should not start or end with a space or hyphen, and it should not contain consecutive spaces or hyphens. Upper or lowercase letters does not matter.

* Phone Number constraints: The phone number must contain only numbers, and be between 3 and 16 digits inclusive. Do not include spaces, extensions or country codes.

* Tag constraints: Tags must be **alphanumeric** (only letters and numbers) and **between 1 to 50 characters long**. Tags are **case-sensitive**.<br>
  e.g. `t/HR`, `t/Department123` are valid; `t/HR Department` (contains space), `t/HR!`(contains special character), and tags longer than 50 characters are invalid.

* If you are using a PDF version of this document, be careful when copying and pasting commands that span multiple lines as space characters surrounding line-breaks may be omitted when copied over to the application.

### Cycle through previous executed commands

You can pre-fill the command box with your last successful command using the **PgUp (up arrow) key** on computer keyboards. This allows users to repeat their last commands without re-typing it in its entirety.

* Use the PgUp (Up arrow) key to move towards older commands, PgDn (Down arrow) key to move towards latest commands.
* Only successful past commands are saved.
* Up to 5 past commands are saved. Thereafter, the oldest command is deleted to accomodate a new one.
* The current pending command is saved when the command history is explored.

### Saving the data

HRmanager data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

HRmanager data are saved automatically as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/HRmanager.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<box type="warning" seamless>

**Caution:**
If your changes to the data file make its format invalid, HRmanager will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run. Hence, it is recommended to take a backup of the file before editing it.<br>
Furthermore, certain edits can cause HRmanager to behave in unexpected ways (e.g., if a value entered is outside the acceptable range). Therefore, edit the data file only if you are confident that you can update it correctly.
</box>

### Archiving data files `[coming in v2.0]`

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app on the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data from your previous HRmanager home folder.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the GUI will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.
2. **If you minimize the Help Window** and then run the `help` command (or use the `Help` menu, or the keyboard shortcut `F1`) again, the original Help Window will remain minimized, and no new Help Window will appear. The remedy is to manually restore the minimized Help Window.
