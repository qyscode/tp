## **Design**

### Architecture

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureDiagram.puml" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** (consisting of classes [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java)) is in charge of the app launch and shut down.
* At app launch, it initializes the other components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down, it shuts down the other components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

The bulk of the app's work is done by the following four components:

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`. (Note: The delete command also supports multiple indexes, e.g., `delete 1 3 5`, which follows the same interaction pattern.)

<puml src="diagrams/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.puml" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<puml src="diagrams/ComponentManagers.puml" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

<puml src="diagrams/UiClassDiagram.puml" alt="Structure of the UI Component"/>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/LogicClassDiagram.puml" width="550"/>

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component, taking `execute("delete 1")` API call as an example. Note that the delete command supports multiple indexes (e.g., `delete 1 3 5`), which follows the same parsing and execution pattern shown below, iterating through each index to delete multiple employees.

<puml src="diagrams/DeleteSequenceDiagram.puml" alt="Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline continues till the end of diagram.
</box>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it is passed to an `AddressBookParser` object which in turn creates a parser that matches the command (e.g., `DeleteCommandParser`) and uses it to parse the command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeleteCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete an employee).<br>
   Note that although this is shown as a single step in the diagram above (for simplicity), in the code it can take several interactions (between the command object and the `Model`) to achieve.
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<puml src="diagrams/ParserClasses.puml" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<puml src="diagrams/ModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores HRmanager's employee records, i.e. all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently selected `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be observed. The UI can be bound to this list so that it updates automatically when the data changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<puml src="diagrams/BetterModelClassDiagram.puml" width="450" />

</box>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2526S2-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<puml src="diagrams/StorageClassDiagram.puml" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both HRmanager data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current HRmanager state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous HRmanager state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone HRmanager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial HRmanager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single HRmanager state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState0.puml" alt="UndoRedoState0" />

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th employee in the HRmanager. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the HRmanager after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted HRmanager state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState1.puml" alt="UndoRedoState1" />

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new employee. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified HRmanager state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState2.puml" alt="UndoRedoState2" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the HRmanager state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</box>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding an employee was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous HRmanager state, and restores the HRmanager to that state.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState3.puml" alt="UndoRedoState3" />


<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</box>

The following sequence diagram shows how an undo operation goes through the `Logic` component:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Logic" />

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</box>

Similarly, how an undo operation goes through the `Model` component is shown below:

<puml src="diagrams/UndoSequenceDiagram-Model.puml" alt="UndoSequenceDiagram-Model" />

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the HRmanager to that state.

<box type="info" seamless>

**Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest HRmanager state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</box>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the HRmanager, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState4.puml" alt="UndoRedoState4" />

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all HRmanager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

<puml src="diagrams/UndoRedoState5.puml" alt="UndoRedoState5" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<puml src="diagrams/CommitActivityDiagram.puml" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire HRmanager.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save an employee being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Search feature

The `search` command is implemented by `SearchCommand`, `SearchCommandParser`, and `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.

The flow is as follows:

1. The user enters `search KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]...`.
2. `AddressBookParser` routes the input to `SearchCommandParser`.
3. `SearchCommandParser` trims the arguments, rejects blank input, rejects searches with more than 100 keywords, and rejects any keyword longer than 100 characters.
4. If parsing succeeds, `SearchCommand` is created with a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
5. `SearchCommand#execute` updates the model's filtered employee list and returns feedback in the form `X employees listed!`.

Matching behavior:

* search is case-insensitive
* only employee names are searched
* each keyword is treated as a partial substring match rather than a full-word match
* multiple keywords are combined using `OR` semantics

This means a command such as `search ali tan` returns employees whose names contain either `ali` or `tan`, regardless of case.

### Statistics Panel

The statistics panel provides real-time workforce metrics displayed permanently on the right side of the application. This feature follows the **Separation of Concerns (SoC)** principle by separating data calculation from UI display.

#### Design Overview

The statistics feature consists of three main components:

1. **`Statistics`** (Model layer): A pure data container that calculates statistics from a list of employees. It has no UI dependencies and is easily testable.
2. **`StatisticsService`** (Service layer): Orchestrates the retrieval of statistics by accessing the filtered employee list from `Logic` and creating a `Statistics` object.
3. **`StatsPanel`** (UI layer): A JavaFX component that displays statistics and listens for changes to the employee list to auto-refresh.

<puml src="diagrams/StatsPanelClassDiagram.puml" width="500" />

#### Implementation Details

**Statistics Class:**
- Takes a `List<Person>` as input
- Calculates total employees, unique tags, most common tag, and tag distribution
- Uses helper methods `findMostCommonTag()` and `createTagDistribution()` for clean separation
- All fields are final and assigned in the constructor

**StatisticsService Class:**
- Acts as a bridge between `Logic` and `Statistics`
- Provides `getCurrentStatistics()` which converts `ObservableList<Person>` to `List<Person>`
- Uses logging to track statistics calculation events

**StatsPanel Class:**
- Extends `UiPart<Region>` with FXML layout
- Listens to `logic.getFilteredPersonList()` for changes
- Updates UI labels when the employee list changes
- Only handles UI updates - no calculation logic

#### Sequence Diagram

The sequence diagram below shows how the statistics panel updates when an employee is added:

<puml src="diagrams/StatsUpdateSequenceDiagram.puml" width="600" />

1. User executes `add` command
2. `LogicManager` executes the command and updates the model
3. `ObservableList` change triggers the listener in `StatsPanel`
4. `StatsPanel` calls `refresh()` → `statisticsService.getCurrentStatistics()`
5. `StatisticsService` creates a new `Statistics` object from the employee list
6. `StatsPanel` updates its labels with the new statistics

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where to place statistics calculation logic**

- **Alternative 1 (current):** Separate `Statistics` class for calculation
    - Pros: Easy to test, follows SRP, reusable
    - Cons: Additional class to maintain

- **Alternative 2:** Calculate statistics directly in `StatsPanel`
    - Pros: Fewer classes
    - Cons: UI layer contains business logic, harder to test

**Aspect: Auto-refresh mechanism**

- **Current choice:** Listener on `ObservableList<Person>`
    - Pros: Updates automatically on any change, no command needed
    - Cons: More complex setup

- **Alternative:** User must type `stats` command
    - Pros: Simpler to implement
    - Cons: Requires manual refresh, less convenient

#### Testing Strategy

- `StatisticsTest`: Unit tests for calculation logic with various employee lists
- `StatisticsServiceTest`: Tests service layer with temporary storage
- `StatisticsServiceIntegrationTest`: Integration tests with actual commands

**Target user profile**: Human Resource Manager

* has a need to manage a significant number of employee and applicant records
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:
- manage employee records faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
- provides fast access to employee details, with sorting options for further clarity
- view job applicants details at a glance and decide whether to proceed with interviews and hiring

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `17` or above installed.
2. The system should respond to user commands within **1 second** under normal usage conditions.
3. The system should be able to store and manage at least **100 employee records** while maintaining command response times within **1 second**.
4. The system should be usable entirely through a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** without requiring graphical interaction such as mouse input.
5. The system should be usable by **HR managers who are not highly technical**, meaning commands should be simple and documentation should clearly explain how to use them.
6. The system should follow **standard Java coding conventions and modular design principles** to ensure maintainability.
7. The system should ensure that employee data stored in the system remains consistent and is not corrupted during normal usage.
8. The system should ensure that employee information stored locally is not transmitted over the network without user intent.
9. The system should remain stable when invalid commands or inputs are entered and should not crash during normal usage.
10. The system should be packaged as a single executable JAR file so that users can run the application without additional installation steps beyond having Java installed.

### Glossary
